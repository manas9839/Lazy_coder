## Lessons Learned

During the development of the Lazy Coder project, I gained valuable knowledge and skills in various areas. Here's a summary of what I learned:

- Django: Through working on this project, I deepened my understanding of the Django framework. I became proficient in leveraging Django's powerful features, such as URL routing, template rendering, and handling HTTP requests and responses.
- Sending Emails with Django: I learned how to implement email functionality using Django's built-in email sending capabilities. This allowed me to send welcome emails to new users upon signup and incorporate email notifications into the application.

- Database Setup: I acquired knowledge on configuring and managing databases within the Django framework. This involved setting up database connections, defining models and relationships, and executing database migrations to ensure data integrity.

- Bug Fixing and Exception Handling: Throughout the development process, I encountered and resolved various bugs and exceptions. This allowed me to develop effective debugging techniques and learn how to handle errors gracefully, ensuring the stability and reliability of the application.

- Functional Views in Django: I gained an understanding of functional views in Django, which allowed me to create dynamic and interactive web pages. I learned how to handle form submissions, process user input, and render appropriate responses using functional views.

- Model Forms: I explored Django's model forms, enabling me to generate forms based on database models effortlessly. This streamlined the creation of forms, form validation, and data handling, enhancing the user experience in data submission and retrieval.

- Customizing User Model and Forms: I delved into customizing the User model and forms provided by Django's authentication system. This enabled me to tailor the user registration and authentication process to the specific requirements of the Lazy Coder project.
